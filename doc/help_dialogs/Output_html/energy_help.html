An event value of 30 is recoded to signify 3 kPa.  If the 100% burner setting corresponds to 6 kPa then the &#39;Value 100%&#39; should be set to 60.  (10x 6 = 60).</td>

The first assumes a constant burner setting for a defined period of time.  An example for Preheating is to set a Duration of 45:00 (45 minutes) at 30% Burner setting.  Percentages may be entered either as a decimal (.30) or a percentage (30%).  When a percentage is entered there a corresponding Duration must be entered.<br><br>The second type of entry is a measured energy value.  This is any value greater than 1.0.  The value can be found by direct measurement using Artisan.  Here are instructions for how to make this measurement.<br><br>An Event must be used to record the burner settings.  Make sure all the values on the Protocol tab are blank or zero.  START a profile recording in Artisan at the beginning of the protocol.  For preheating that would be when the burner(s) are first turned on.  For BBP is will be the start of BBP, usually at the end of the previous roast or the end of preheating.  Record any burner setting changes in the appropriate event.  STOP the recording at the end of the protocol.  Save the recorded protocol for safe keeping.  Review the energy used results.  The units that results are displayed in may need to be changed to match the units set on the Burners tab.  If there are multiple burners used it may be necessary to add up the energy used for each individual burner from the table in the Details tab.
